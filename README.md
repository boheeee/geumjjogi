# Recognizing 100 won and 10 won, calculate the sum and represent the coordinates of the center point with OpenCV 

### It has been added so that the coordinates of the center point can be known from the existing recognition.
Using OpenCV and Python.\
This project was made by referring to [here](https://deep-learning-study.tistory.com/214).\
It was decided to create a program that recognizes coins separately and calculates the total.\
But it came out right away after a little search.\
So we added, with our own ingenuity, to tell the coordinates of the centroid of the coin.
## Used Packages and Versions:
1. python()
2. opencv
3. numpy
4. image
5. adf

## How to execute:
